# Present Slides - PDF Viewer with AI Explanations

A web application that allows users to upload PDFs and view them page by page with AI-powered explanations generated by Google's Gemini API.

## Features

- 📄 Upload PDF files via drag-and-drop or file picker
- 📖 View PDF pages one at a time with smooth navigation
- 🤖 AI-generated explanations using **Groq** (Llama 4 Scout) or **Google Gemini**
- 📊 Detailed analysis of graphs, charts, and data tables
- ⚡ Fast performance - all explanations generated upfront
- 🎨 Modern, responsive UI

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory. Use **at least one** of these keys (you can use both):

```
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

- **Groq** (recommended, generous free tier): Get a key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com). If both keys are set, Groq is used first to avoid Gemini rate limits.
- **Gemini**: Get a key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Upload a PDF file using the upload interface
2. Wait for the AI to generate explanations for all pages (this happens automatically)
3. Navigate through pages using the Previous/Next buttons
4. View the AI-generated explanation for the current page in the side panel

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- Vite
- PDF.js for PDF rendering
- Groq API (Llama 4 Scout vision) and/or Google Gemini API for AI explanations
